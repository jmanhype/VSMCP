# VSMCP v0.1.0 Release Notes

## 🎉 Initial Release

The first public release of VSMCP (Viable System Model Cybernetic Platform) - a comprehensive Elixir implementation of Stafford Beer's Viable System Model with modern distributed systems capabilities.

### 🚀 Core Features

#### VSM Implementation
- **Complete Systems 1-5**: Full implementation of all VSM subsystems
  - System 1: Operational units with autonomous operation
  - System 2: Coordination mechanisms for conflict resolution
  - System 3: Operational management and resource allocation
  - System 3*: Audit and monitoring capabilities
  - System 4: Strategic planning and environmental scanning
  - System 5: Policy and identity management

#### Distributed Capabilities
- **AMQP Integration**: RabbitMQ-based nervous system for inter-system communication
  - Connection pooling and channel management
  - Topic-based routing for VSM channels
  - Automatic reconnection and fault tolerance
  
- **CRDT Support**: Conflict-free replicated data types for distributed state
  - G-Counter, PN-Counter, OR-Set, LWW-Register implementations
  - PubSub-based synchronization
  - Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC) for causality tracking
  
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol support
  - Tool registry and capability discovery
  - WebSocket and TCP transport layers
  - Adaptive delegation between VSM systems

#### Security & Resilience
- **Neural Bloom Filters**: Probabilistic security filtering
- **Z3N Zone Control**: Multi-zone security architecture
- **Event-driven security**: Real-time threat detection and response

#### Architecture
- **Phoenix PubSub**: Event-driven communication backbone
